This is a record of what I have done durin the process of fitting different kinds of functions with the help of DNN.

fit.py is the original code I used to do experiments.
fitnd_tf2_1.ipynb records my experiments on functions with high dimension and low frequency.
fitnd_tf2_2.ipynb records my experiments on functions with high dimension and high frequency.
fitnd_tf2_3.ipynb records my experiments on functions with low dimension and low frequency.
fitnd_tf2_4.ipynb records my experiments on functions with low dimension and high frequency.
fitnd_tf2_5.ipynb records my experiments on functions with low dimension embedded in high dimension.
fitnd_tf2_5-Copy1.ipynb records my experiments on functions with low dimension embedded in high dimension, but the target function is different from that one in fitnd_tf2_5.ipynb.
images contains some pictures wihch is plotted during the training process.
